[IBM Data Science Professional Certificate ](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?)

This repository presents all of my notebooks I had to complete in order to pass the final exam and get the certificate. In that assignment, I had to present my skills from different subject I was learning during the course:<br><br>

<b>
    <li>SQL</li> 
    <li>data manipulation</li> 
    <li>EDA</li> 
    <li>data visualization</li> 
    <li>classification models</li> 
    <li>web scrapping</li> 
</b>
<br>
The final presentation concludes all of my work.
